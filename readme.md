🚗 Vehicle Rental System 🚗

The Vehicle Rental System is a backend API designed to efficiently manage the core operations of a modern vehicle rental business. It provides a structured and secure way to handle vehicles, customers, bookings, and authentication.

The system allows administrators to manage the vehicle inventory, including adding, updating, and tracking vehicle availability in real time. Customers can create and manage their accounts, view available vehicles, and make rental bookings with ease. The booking module handles the full rental lifecycle—from reserving a vehicle to returning it—while automatically calculating rental costs based on duration and pricing rules.

Security is a key focus of the system. It implements authentication and role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific features. Admins have full management privileges, while customers are limited to their own profiles and bookings. Overall, this API provides a scalable, reliable foundation for building a complete vehicle rental application.
